This is a simple snake game that i made using Vanila JS, CSS and HTML.
My main purporse building it was to use new learned canvas and local storage skills in some project.
The project can be vieved and tested on my gitHub pages test site here: https://thekapitankorek.github.io/snake/
It has the option to play both singleplayer and with somebody else on the same computer.

Enjoy!
